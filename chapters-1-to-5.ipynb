    "Simple exponential growth can be written as $\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN$, where the simple integration leads to $N(t) = N_0e^{rt}$. Here, the per capita growth rate remains constant for all population sizes: crowding has no effect on these individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this system, because it is unbounded in growth, there is only one equilibrium, $N* = 0$. As long as $r > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable, and for $r < 0$, the equilibrium is asymptotically stable. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is a simplistic model and not one well-equiped to bound population growth, either by density-dependence (intrinsic) nor by environmental factors (extrinsic). If we consider a model where the per capita growth rate falls linearly with population size, this can be thought of as density-dependent regulation, and formulated as $\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(1-\\frac{N}{K})$. This is known as the Pearl-Verhulst equation, and has an exact anlytical solution. The two equilibria, N* = 0 and N* = K, both have growth rates = 0. Near N* = 0, $N^2/K$ is small compared to N, so that $\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN$. For r > 0, N* = 0 is unstable.  "
